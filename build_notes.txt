Build Instructions (Mac OSX)



1. Install CUDA development tools (v6.5).

	Make sure to use the link for cuda with gt9xx support:
	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads-geforce-gtx9xx
	See guide at: http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Mac.pdf

	add symlink for lib64 folder
	sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda/lib /usr/local/cuda/lib64



2. Setup Path variables for CUDA.

	export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/lib64
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
	PATH=${CUDA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}	
	export PATH
 

3. Make sure mpir is installed and setup correctly.
	Download from: http://mpir.org
	tar -xvf mpir-2.7.0-alpha12.tar.bz2
	cd mpir-2.7.0
	./configure
	make
	make install
	



4. Make sure libcurl is installed and setup correctly.

	Taken from: http://dahu.co.uk/blog/?p=77

follow these steps to get and build libcurl:

Go to http://curl.haxx.se/download.html and download the latest ‘source archive’, and get the ‘tar’ version. At the time of writing, this is curl-7.24.0.tar
When its downloaded, move the tar file from your downloads folder to a temporary folder of your choice (e.g. ~/Desktop/libcurl)
open a temporary window and change directory to the temporary folder
expand the tar file:
 tar -xvf curl-7.24.0.tar
the expansion will have created a sub-directory. CD into curl-7.24.0 and then issue the following commands:
./configure
make
make test
sudo make install
‘configure’ will set up the build environment for the platform concerned (OSX in this case), ‘make’ will do the actual build, ‘make test’ will run the unit tests to ensure everything is working ok (note that these tests might take five minutes to complete) and ‘sudo make install’ will move the various components into sensible places for the environment. Note also that because we will be moving files to some system locations, you should run the install as root using sudo – give it your administration password.
That’s it – the install all done. the make install will have put our header files in:

/Usr/local/include/curl
and the libraries in

/Usr/local/lib/libcurl.a
/Usr/local/lib/libcurl.dylib





5. Make build files executable

	chmod +x autogen.sh
	chmod +x configure
	chmod +x install-sh




6. Make sure Makefile.am supports subdirectories.
	This line should be in the Makefile.am file after the other declarations:
		AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = subdir-objects




7. Add symlink to README pointing to our readme file.
	ln -s README.txt README

8. Fix linking against standard libraries.
	There is an issue with newer version of OSX building against libc instead of libstd.
	Make sure -stdlib=libstdc++ is added to CXXFLAGS.
	eg add this to configure.sh
	"CXXFLAGS= -O3 -stdlib=libstdc++"



8. Build It!
	make clean
	./autogen.sh
	sh configure.sh
	make
